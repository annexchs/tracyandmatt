	        <p class="list-deck">Hall's Chophouse&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="label">Downtown</span></p>
	        <p>Hall’s was where Lynn first told Tracy that she felt that she was a part of their family, only two weeks after Matt and Tracy had met ☺ There have been many Cruse family gatherings at Halls. The service is very good and the owners go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Every Sunday Hall’s hosts a “Gospel Brunch” which features wonderful soul singers on the piano. They have everything from tender steak to decadent southern sides.  </p>
	        
	        <p class="list-deck">Muse&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="label">Downtown</span></p>
	        <p>An intimate Mediterranean style restaurant on a quaint side street downtown.  This is where Tracy and Matt shared their very first meal together. The atmosphere is more on the quiet, intimate side.  </p>
	        
	        	        <p class="list-deck">Barsa&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="label">Downtown</span></p>

	        <p>This is Matt and Tracy’s favorite late night stop. They have FRESH ramen noodles that are incredibly tasty. Would recommend this as a late night food option or as a casual lunch or dinner.  </p>
	        
	        	        <p class="list-deck">Coast&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="label">Downtown</span></p>
	        <p>Wonderful, engaging atmosphere that is almost a combination of industrial and coastal. Obviously they specialize in seafood and have very tasty dishes. They also have a lot of fun, delicious cocktails.  </p>
	        
	        	        <p class="list-deck">The Macintosh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="label">Downtown</span></p>

	        <p>A delicious Italian choice. They have a beautiful patio outside that Matt’s brother Brian’s company constructed. You can’t go wrong with any plate.  </p>
	        
	        	        <p class="list-deck">Oku&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="label">Downtown</span></p>
	        <p>If you are looking for sushi while visiting Charleston, Oku is your place, located right on King Street. With a modern, posh atmosphere, they have very trendy sushi, entrées, and cocktails.  Oku is a part of the restaurant group that is catering the wedding!  </p>

	        <p>The Lot is by far Matt and Tracy’s favorite restaurant. They have spent many date nights there. The Lot is a cozy, rustic feeling farm to table restaurant. They do not have printed menus at this restaurant, as it changes on a daily basis. The chef is trained in butchery, making any meat option you choose extremely creative and delicious. This restaurant is a perfect example of a foodie’s paradise.  </p>
	        
	        	        	        <p class="list-deck">The Lost Dog&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="label">Folly Beach / James Island</span></p>
	        <p>The Lost Dog is a family favorite for both the Cruse family and the Najarian family.  Matt’s parents dine here nearly weekly and Tracy’s family reunion has dined here on multiple occasions. If you are looking for brunch The Lost Dog is your place! </p>

	        <p>Logger heads was the bar where Tracy and Matt officially met each other! It is right next to the beach and is a great hang out. Their food is mostly standard bar fair but if you are looking for drinks by the beach this is a great choice! The outside patio/deck at Logger Heads is also another location that Brian’s construction company built.  Check out the bar surface, its awesome! </p>
	        
	        	        	        <p class="list-deck">Blu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="label">Folly Beach / James Island</span></p>
	        <p>Blu is a restaurant/bar located in the downstairs of the hotel directly on Folly Beach. It is the only restaurant on folly that is actually on the water and just inches away for the sand. You really cannot beat the location here.   </p>

	        <p class="deck">Fun Activities to do in Charleston</p>
	        <p class="list-deck">Carriage Rides&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	        <p>The carriage rides can be found on market street in downtown Charleston. They are a great way to see and learn about the history of Charleston.   </p>
	        
	        <p class="list-deck">Farmers Market at Marion Square&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	        <p> In the center of downtown every Saturday morning is the local farmers market. There is everything from food trucks, local crafters, live music, and freshly made food to enjoy. This is a great option for something to do the Saturday of the wedding!   </p>

	        <p class="list-deck">The Battery&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	        <p>If you are looking for a place to walk, run, bike, or drive through you have got to check out The Battery. The Battery is where all the most beautiful mansion homes of Charleston are located. We personally love to play the “where would we live game” when exploring The Battery.    </p>
