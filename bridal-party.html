From day one Tracy has been so proud to be Kelly’s “big sistow.”  From countless hours playing Barbies, horses, and pool rescue to traveling the world together, these sisters have a very special bond. Tracy has been so lucky and honored to share her childhood with someone as special as Kelly. Kelly has such a genuine heart, one that lights up with children, good food, travel, and family.  Kelly and Tracy have a language all their own, one that stems from a lifetime of silliness, honesty, and true love for one another. She is currently receiving her degree in speech pathology from North Eastern University in Boston, MA and dreams of working with children with speech and language impairments. </p>

	        <p>Brian is my older brother and co-founder of Unique Constructors based out of Charleston, SC. Brian has always been the best brother and role model anyone could ask for. He has taught me so many lessons over the years and while he may not want to take the blame for this, I can say without a doubt that I wouldn’t be the person I am today without him. Even my decision to come to Charleston would not have happened without Brian. While riding down Calhoun St. during a visit in my teens, a college student nearly stepped out in front of Brian’s truck, prompting an exclamation of “Damn college kid!”. My immediate response of, “Woah, there’s a college here?!” set the gears in motion that would eventually lead to me meeting Tracy and finding the piece I hadn’t realized I was missing. I will be forever grateful to that absent minded college student and to Brian’s assertive driving. </p>

My favorite part about our friendship was that even though we only saw each other a few times a year, every summer we would pick up right where we left off without missing a beat. That same quality holds true today. We may only have the opportunity to visit once or twice a year but it’s always some of the best times of the year when we’re together. </p>

At the time Brian and Forrest were spending a significant amount of time hitting the gym and I remember being a bit intimidated by this big guy doing pull ups in the living room. During that trip Forrest went out of his way to talk with 12 year old me and make me feel like one of the guys. I learned at that time that this big guy had an even bigger heart. Anyone who knows Forrest can attest to the truth of that observation and to the warmth he brings to any gathering.  </p>

	        <p>Before college I considered myself a bit of a loner. Something of a one man wolf pack. Jimmy and I met freshman year of college after I heard metal music being played at a bordering-on-misdemeanor decibel level and thought to myself, “whoever that is, we need to be friends.” When I discovered that in addition to having the ability to cram a 3000W sound system in an 800 square foot dorm room, Jimmy also shared my passion for all things dorky and nerdy, I knew that he was one of my own. And my wolf pack.. it grew by one. </p>

	        <p>Nathaniel is my brother-in-law and father of the century to our two beautiful flower girls, Evelyn and Penelope. When I first met Nathaniel I was 11 or 12 and hadn’t yet fully owned my own love of all things dorky and nerdy. Nathaniel would play video games with me and talk to me about all of the interests I wasn’t able to talk about passionately with my peers. He always went out of his way to spend time with me and give me advice; often opening my mind to new areas and ideas I had yet to encounter. These early interactions speak to the core of Nathaniel’s character. He is a truly compassionate person who makes all around him feel welcome and supported. I don’t think I would have found who I am as quickly as I have without his support.</p>

	        <p>Perry and I met in a game design class my freshman year of school when we worked together on what was hands down the best game in the class. It was a couple semesters later when Perry TAed my Python class that our friendship came into its own. When I think about Perry the first thing that comes to mind is LAN parties and deep discussions of topics far and wide. To the uninitiated, a LAN party is when you and friends get your computers together and connect them via a Local Area Network to play games. We would often get together and game for hours on end. During these gatherings, Perry and I would have in depth conversations across wide ranging topics. These conversations were some of the most stimulating and thought provoking I’ve had and are among my warmest memories. </p>

I remember I was at a Charleston Mix event with a buddy of mine who Ryan had only met once before. Despite having a million and one things to do for the event, Ryan not only remembered him, but was genuinely invested in how he had been; even asking follow up questions to their brief conversation months before. To me that perfectly summarizes who Ryan is; a man who is empathetic to, and invested in, everyone he meets. </p>
