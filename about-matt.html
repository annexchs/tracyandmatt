	        <h1>About Matt</h1>
	        <p class="deck">As told by Tracy...</p>
	        <p>Where to start! There are so many amazing things about Matt! The first thing I fell for would definitely have to be his laugh, the one where his whole body laughs with him, is my favorite thing in the entire world. It is impossible to not laugh right along with him.  You can literally hear it across rooms, which makes it that much more impossible to not laugh along with. Matt is one special person. He is the perfect combination of silly, charming, kind, and intelligent.  He truly is the most caring, kind, and considerate person I have ever met. </p>
	        <p>And the best part is that it comes from the most genuine place in his heart. Matt has such a gift for making me feel like I never have to be anyone else but exactly who I am. He never passes judgment on others because he has this wonderful ability to see people and situations from many different perspectives.  It is very easy to feel comfortable and content in Matt’s calming presence, without him I would have easily fallen into craziness on many occasions! Like I say frequently, ‘he is the calm to my crazy.’  Matt is my best friend.  No matter what the problem is, he is somehow always able to come up with some solution, even if the solution is just asking ‘what can I do to make it better’ or simply just having him next to me.
  </p>

<p>Matt has an amazing love and appreciation for his parents, siblings, nieces, family members, and close friends. If you are lucky enough to know Matt, you know first hand how loyal and loving he is to the people he cares so much about.  I feel like the luckiest girl in the world every day being in love with this incredible human. I cannot wait to be his wife! </p>
